  "Minutes to Midnight" was Linkin Park's third studio album released in 2007. The album marked the transition from the band's rock-rap hbyrid style to a more traditional punk sound. Some saw the transition away from mixing in rap as a sellout of the band's identity, while others saw it as a step in the direction of musical maturity. Regardless of the opinions, hits such as "What I've Done" and "Shadow of the Day" resulted from the albums release. "Shadow of the Day," perhaps the most emotional track on the work, is about the passing of a close friend to the band. The track features new elements to Linkin Park such as more incorporation of string instruments and the addition of an organ at the tail end of the song to solidify the chilling tribute.
