  Have you ever listened to a song from a mixtape or album and wondered what the story, if any, was behind it? Look no further for that answer than Mesh. Mesh is a website dedicated to delivering the contextual background of mixtapes, albums, and individual songs within those works. By doing this it may not only provide a newfound sense of appreciation for the artist's work for those who have listened in the past; but also open up new listening opportunities to those who may have not been exposed to the content beforehand.
  Enter the youtube button that you will see in the top right of your screen. The primary use of this button is for the reader to explore the work of the particular artist or artist's work he or she is reading about. Mesh covers a variety of genres, from hip-hop, to punk rock, and everything in between. With that Mesh hopes you enjoy your experience and perhaps stumble upon a new favorite artist or release.
