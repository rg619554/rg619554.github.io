  Many hip-hop fans know Future's "56 Nights" for its hits such as "March Madness" and "Never Gon' Lose." However, many don't know the story behind the name of club-banger track list. A popular rumor is that the mixtape was produced in only 56 nights, but the title actually deals with Future's beat producer, DJ Esco, encountering the police in Dubai. DJ Esco was imprisoned in Dubai after a show for 56 nights due to the possession of 15 grams of marijuana. His experience in the prison brought him understanding of different cultures in Dubai along with shedding light on his situation, since he was the only American in the prison. Upon his release, DJ Esco and Future released the mixtape entitled "56 Nights" in rememberance of the experience.
