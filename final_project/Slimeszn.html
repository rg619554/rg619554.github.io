  Young Thug, before the release of Slime Season, had accumulated popularity through features on hit tracks "Lifestyle" and "About the Money." Slime Season was his first self titled work that increased that popularity and has since been continued with "Slime Season 2" and "Slime Season 3." Thugger's unique vocals coupled with various melodic beats helped solidify "Slime Season" as a legitimate release for the up and coming rapper. Along with 18 songs on the debut mixtape, Young Thug also managed to snag Lil Wayne as a feature on the song "Take Kare" which certainly added to his relevancy and perhaps longevity as rapper in the game.
