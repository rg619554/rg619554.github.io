  Acid Rap was the mixtape that brought Chance the Rapper into the Hip-hop spotlight in 2013. Tracks such as "Acid Rain" and "Cocoa Butter Kisses" showcased the Chicago native's versatility with melodies and flows, while establishing his content as real and relatable. The topics he raps about are all expereiences that Chance has familiarity with which brings an authentic element to this body of work which other mainstream content seems to lack. The mixtape is still considered by many as his best work, although his upcoming mixtape, "Chance 3," is believed by many to have the potential to claim that title.
